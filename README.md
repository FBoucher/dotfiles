# Frank Boucher does dotfiles

This is a tiny part of what's [jldeen](https://github.com/jldeen/dotfiles) and [holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) did. Their solution was to complex/ complete for what I needed. I wanted to understand all the pieces so I start from nothing... If you want the 100% complete version go see their projects it's pure gold!


### Notes
Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

There is no automation for now it's more a central place to put config files... :)

## what's inside

A lot of stuff. Seriously, a lot of stuff. Check them out in the file browser
above and see what components may mesh up with you.
[Fork holman's](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/fork) or [Fork mine](htps://github.com/jldeen/dotfiles/fork), remove what you don't
use, and build on what you do use.

## components

There's a few special files in the hierarchy.



```
# tmux
echo ''
echo "Now installing tmux ..."
echo ''
sudo apt-get install tmux -y
```
